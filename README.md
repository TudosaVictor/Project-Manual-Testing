<h1> Manual Testing Project </h1>

   The scope of the final project is to use all gained knowledge throught the course and apply them in practice, using a live application.
      
   Application under test: https://www.aeries.com/solutions/demo/
  
   API Documentation: https://support.aeries.com/support/solutions/articles/14000077926-aeries-api-full-documentation
  
   The final project will be split into 2 sections:  X and Y
  
   Tools used: JIRA, Zephyr Squad, Postman, MySQL Workbench.
